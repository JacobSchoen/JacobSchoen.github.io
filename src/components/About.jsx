        This portfolio website was created using react.js with JavaScript. All
        the 3D graphics were created using ThreeJS and React Three Fiber.
        TailwindCSS was used to for its dynamic styling to work on web or mobile
        devices. The animations you see on the components were created with
        Framer motion. EmailJS was used to integrate with the contact form to
        send messages to my personnel email.
